# Ido Operating System

An educational operating system implementation project for the **Bagrut in Cyber** program.

---

## Project Overview

Following my teacher’s advice, I decided to split the project into multiple components.  
For each component, I’ll design **two versions**:

1. **Minimal Solution** – a simple, working implementation.  
2. **Enhanced Solution** – a more advanced version with extra features or optimizations.

A detailed breakdown table will be added soon.

## Current Progress

I’ve successfully built a **minimal OS** that **GRUB can boot** and a simple implementation of printk (that supports format string).

## Next Steps

Implement GDT

Maybe rewrite in C++
